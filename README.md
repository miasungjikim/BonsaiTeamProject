# BonsaiTeamProject
 The repository contains our group work for the Integrated Studio we course at Yoobee Colleges.
 We've choosen Scenario2, which is focuses on developing  an inventory and staff management for a fictional boutique retailier specialising company named Aotearoa Treasures.


# About the project
The main idea of this project is to build a system that helps manage stock and employees across different store locations.
It should allow the admin to see low-stock items, update the inventory, and manage staff schedules.
Users will also be able to choose a store, view products, and make purchases that update the stock in real-time.
