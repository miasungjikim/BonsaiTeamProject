# BonsaiTeamProject

This repository contains the group work completed for the *Integrated Studio I* course at Yoobee Colleges.

We chose **Scenario 2**, which focuses on developing a terminal-based inventory and staff management system for a fictional boutique retailer, **Aotearoa Treasures Ltd.**, specializing in New Zealand-made handicrafts and souvenirs.

## ??? About the Project

The goal of this project is to create a centralized system to manage products and employees across multiple store locations (Auckland, Wellington CBD, Christchurch). The system allows:

- Admin users to manage inventory and staff schedules
- Regular users to select a store, browse available products, and make purchases

Inventory updates happen in real time, and low-stock alerts help admins take timely action.
